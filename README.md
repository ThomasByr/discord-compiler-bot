## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

> **Note**
> This project was done in a week so do not expect crazy behavior and be immune to bugs.

This is a Discord compiler bot which can compile / interpret code blocks and display the result. Keep in mind that we're working in discord. This means, of course, that we have many operating restraints. Here's a few of the big ones.

- Complicated syntax for non-trivial compilations
- Limited output length (limited to a couple hundred characters)
- Single-file input only

Please read [the Wiki](https://github.com/ThomasByr/discord-compiler-bot/wiki) for more.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Usage

First you should install the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) for your operating system. Then, you should create a new `.env` file on the model of the `.env.example`. You should at least set `BOT_TOKEN` and `APPLICATION_ID` (you can let other fields untouched) environnement variables.

```ps1
cargo run --release
```

The bot should then connect to the servers and if succesfull, show a list of debug commands on the go.

## üíÅ Get Help

While in discord, please type `;help` to get generic help and show a list of available commands, or type `;help <cmd>` to get help about a specific command. Here is a list of the most usefull ones.

- `;format` on a code block with the language set will trigger a format command for the language
- `;compile` will compile and run a code block with the given language
- `;languages` will show a menu to display all languages
- `;asm` will transform the code block into Assembly \_x86_64 for linux

## üî∞ Support

Support for following languages : c++, c, java, python, ruby, rust, javascript, go, php, lua and many more.

On a side note, support has been added for ARM architectures. Meaning you can now host the bot yourself on a Raspberry PI without any tweaks to the code ! But you will need to compile it yourself though...
